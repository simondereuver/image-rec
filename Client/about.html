            This is a project I am developing on my free time as a fun and interactive way to further develope
            my programming skills. The aim of this project is to learn how to create a website using JavaScript,
            create API's and integrate different software components, such as a website server, database and more.

            My name is Simon de Reuver, I am a student pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at
            Jönköping University's School of Engineering (JTH). As a Computer Engineering student I delve
            into diverse subjects such as software development, programming languages, network design, AI
            and system architecture, gaining skills in the digital landscape. This project is available on
