# IMAGE RECOGNITION WEBSITE

This is a freetime project I will make during summer. The intent of this project is to learn how to make a website and using predefined AI models, in preparation for future courses.

The main idea of this project is to create a website where users are able to
upload a picture and a AI model will classify the image. As this is the first version it will be updated along the way when new ideas and features come to mind.

## Program specifications and languages

The server-side of the website will be programmed using JavaScript with Node.js as the runtime enviroment including Express as the framework.

The client side will be programmed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

A relational database will be implemented, as of yet which version has not been decided upon, SQLite is considered to be used.

### Features
Upload an image to the website.
Image classification of uploaded pictures to the website.

More features to come.
