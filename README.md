# IMAGE RECOGNITION

This is a project I will make during summer. The intent of this project is to learn how to make a website and using predefined AI models.

The main idea of this project is to create a website where users are able to
upload a picture and a AI model will classify the image. As this is the first version it will be updated along the way when new ideas and features come to mind.

## Features
Uploading pictures to website.
What percentage of certainty that the AI model can classify the image as.

More features to come.


### Workflow idea

Divide the problem into two main parts. Eventually integrate the AI to the website and run the pictures in the model.

#### AI PART

**First priority**
Learn about AI and what models to use. I have used this website to read about image classification and what to use for this project. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/image-classification#prerequisites. Divide the project into two parts, website and AI.

**Second priority**
Test to setup and run the AI model as a simple project. 

##### WEBSITE PART

**First priority**
Read and learn about how to create and setup a website.

**Second priority**
Create the website
